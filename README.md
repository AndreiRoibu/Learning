# Learning
A repository centralizing all my independent learning activities, from past courses to current small projects and workshops.

# Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have `just` and `uv` installed. If you don't, run:

```bash
brew install just uv
```

Then, clone the repository and simply run:

```bash
just install
```

Finally, remember to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

# Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different learning activity, such as a course, workshop or small project. Inside each folder, you'll find a `README.md` file that provides more details about the specific activity.

The table below summarizes each learning activity. To learn more about a specific activity, click on its name to navigate to its dedicated folder, and read my blog post about it.

The "Run Locally?" column indicates whether the activity can be run locally on your machine.
* If ✅ you can follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` file to set it up and run it on your own system.
* If ❌ it means the activity is designed to be run in a cloud environment or requires specific hardware or software that may not be available on your local machine.
* If ⚙️, it means that the activity is a work in progress that I have not yet finished.
